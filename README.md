A time series is a series of data points indexed in time order. Most commonly, a time series is a sequence taken at successive equally spaced points in time. Thus it is a sequence of discrete-time data. For example, stock prices over a fixed period of time, hotel bookings, ecommerce sales, waether cycle reports etc.
